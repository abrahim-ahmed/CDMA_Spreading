# Code Division Multiple Access(CDMA)  <img align="left" alt="matlab" width="45px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" style="padding-right:10px;" />
Is a type of spread-spectrum communication technology.

Hereâ€™s 5 simplified explanation of how CDMA spreading signals work:
 
1. Spreading Code: Each user is assigned a unique spreading code, which is a pseudo-random sequence of bits. This code runs at a much higher rate than the data to be transmitted.
2. Spreading Process: The data signal is combined with the spreading code using a bitwise XOR operation. This process spreads the data signal over a wider bandwidth.
3. Transmission: The spread signal is transmitted over the communication channel. Because the signal is spread over a wide frequency range, it appears as noise to unintended receivers.
4. Despreading: At the receiver end, the same spreading code is used to despread the signal. This process recovers the original data signal by correlating the received signal with the spreading code.
5. Interference Rejection: One of the key advantages of CDMA is its ability to reject interference. Since each user has a unique spreading code, the receiver can filter out signals from other users, which appear as noise.

   This technique allows multiple users to share the same frequency band simultaneously without significant interference, making it highly efficient for wireless communication.


I wish thet my codes will help you Understand and benefit from it.


CDMA signal Code will work in Matlab.
